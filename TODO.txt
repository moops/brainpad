1. replace reminder_type with tags
2. fix workout.route

3. get rid of 2 feeds on the main page and move them somewhere else (maybe an ajax expanding area)
4. reverse the sort journal entries so newest is at the top
5. sort the accounts in the money form

6. add the following css to add a text seperator between the inline list of tasks due today on the home page
    #inline-list-gen ul li:after {
    content: ", ";
    }
        
    #inline-list-gen ul li.last:after {
    content: ". ";
    }
